📌 Insights Derived
Outlets established before 2015 tend to have higher average sales.

"Fruits and Vegetables" and "Canned" items show consistently strong sales across outlet types.

High visibility doesn’t always mean high sales – a moderate visibility often correlates with better performance.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrate time-series forecasting for demand prediction.

Add more product-level attributes like brand or packaging type.

Enable real-time dashboard updates with live data.
